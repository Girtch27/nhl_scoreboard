Description: # NHL Scoreboard
        Scoreboard for your fav NHL team.
        Thanks to nhl_goal_light
        
        ## Overview
        
        NHL Scoreboard written in python3 for raspberry pi GPIO. Works with any team but currently hardcoded...
        
        To start application, use following commands:
        	
            $ sudo python3 NHL_Scoreboard.py
        
        ***
        ### Materials
        
        For documentation on how to wire the GPIOs with the lights and the button, pleaser refer to the "docs" folder.
        
        * Raspberry Pi (currently using raspberry pi A model, but any model will work)
        * Red Rotating Beacon Warning Light from ebay
        * 5V 2 Channel Relay Module from ebay
        * Momentary OFF ON Push Round Button
        * 12V to 5V 1A adapter (used a car usb adapter) would be good to have a dual usb adapter in case you need to plug something else like a usb speaker.
        * 3.5mm audio extension cable
        
        ***
        ### Audio
        
        If you wish to change the audio clips to sounds with your teams goal horn and music, just download them, rename them (goal_horn_#.mp3) and save them in the "audio" folder.
        
        ***
        ### Delay
        Not used, if needed will update.
        I've teste my code while watching Rogers Gamecenter Live and the stream seems to be a bit delayed, so I added a delay to my code to make the goal horn start later. You will be prompted to enter a delay that works with your stream.
